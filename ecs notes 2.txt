# MapDisplay

NO Grabs all position and orbit components with a specific system.

# Systems

* GodMapDisplay: for all system components == this system:
                  for all position and orbit components, display

# Components

* orbit: parent_id, radius, offset, hierarchy, speed_parameter
  - note: L4/L5 positions are stored as their own orbits
* id:
* x,y,system_id: position in a system

# Notes

- Model populations as their own entities.
- Minerals on a body can be mined.
- Minerals on a population have already been mined, and can be used.
- Consider splitting MapDisplay's version of bodies from the reality?
  - Reason A: It will also need to store contacts, and should not always have all info
  - Reason B: Orbital positions should only be updated by an orbital processor when needed
  - Reason C: Reduce duplication by making the orbital processor the only thing that updates positions?
