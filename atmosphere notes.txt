1.7x10^2 -> 0.0063atm, 120km  | 3.72 m/s^2
1x10^4 -> 1atm, 120km         | 9.8  m/s^2
1x10^6 -> 91.7atm, 250km      | 8.87 m/s^2


x = cos(t / radius) -> T = 2pi * radius

star variables -> light output
 energy received (light based on distance)
 + terrestrial values (magnetosphere, composition) -> atmospheric composition
  atmospheric composition -> habitability (plus mineral availability)

636 = 3.72 m/s^2 * ?
